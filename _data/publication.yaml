    support on demand services. It is a style of computing where massively scalable
    resources are delivered as a service to external customers using Internet technologies.
    Scheduling in cloud is responsible for selection of best suitable resources for
    task execution, by taking some static and dynamic parameters and restrictions
    of tasks' into consideration. The users' perspective of efficient scheduling may
    be based on parameters like task completion time …

  description: ABSTRACT In grid environment multiple resource providers work together
    in order to accomplish a complex job. The service level agreement is negotiated
    between client and a provider for executing the job on high performance computing
    resources. Most of today grid applications consist of highly correlated tasks.
    The performance of the workflow application containing highly correlated tasks
    mainly depends on scheduling. This paper proposes an improved SLA based Grid scheduling
    for workflow application using improved …

  description: Abstract A grid is a framework providing services to access and manage
    distributed hardware and software resources. A thorough authentication is required
    before any requested access or operation is allowed on any resource of the grid.
    In particular, much risk is involved when the grid is used for e-commerce where
    it is necessary to share resources with unknown parties. It is difficult for a
    resource user on the grid to identify the quality of the resource providers. Trust
    is one mechanism with which one can identify the quality of the …

    protocol for MANETs which is an extension of ZRP by using Genetic Algorithm (GA).
    GZRP uses GA on IERP and BRP parts of ZRP to provide a limited set of alternative
